Example of broken dlsym(RTLD_NEXT) after r294373,r294470,r294936.
It is returning the function's own address instead of NULL if there
are no more symbols following it.  This only happens when the library
is dlopen'd.  If it is linked in then there is no problem.

dlopen test:

# make
# ./test

Linked test:

# make
# ./test_linked
